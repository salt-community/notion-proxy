# Proxy API for Notion

This API provides information about consultants and their respective responsible people. Below are the available endpoints, the structure of their responses, and usage examples.

## Base URL
The API is deployed and can be accessed at:

`https://notion-proxy-735865474111.europe-west4.run.app`

## Authorization

All requests to this API must include an API key in the request header. The API key should be passed using the `X-API-KEY` header.
Currently, the only way to get an API key is to be given one directly from us.

### Example:

```bash
X-API-KEY: your-api-key
```

Without a valid API key, requests will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.
